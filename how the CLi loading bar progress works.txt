Looking at the CLI output, the progress bar showing percentages (4.1%, 11.4%, 17.9%, etc.) during the "Creating Categories" step is being generated by the **`printProgressBar`** function located in:

**File: `src/agents/PLEXOS_functions/loading_bar.py`**

Here's the relevant code:

```python
def printProgressBar(iteration, total, prefix='', suffix='', decimals=1, length=20, fill='█'):
    """
    Call in a loop to create terminal progress bar
    """
    percent = ("{0:." + str(decimals) + "f}").format(100 * (iteration / float(total)))
    filledLength = int(length * iteration // total)
    bar = fill * filledLength + '-' * (length - filledLength)
    print('\r%s |%s| %s%% %s' % (prefix, bar, percent, suffix), end='\r')
    
    # Also save progress to file for Streamlit to read
    save_progress(
        task_name=prefix or "Progress", 
        current=iteration,
        total=total,
        message=f"{prefix} {suffix}"
    )
```

This function is being called from **`src/agents/plexos_base_model_final.py`** in the `_common_build_steps` function:

```python
# 1) Create Categories
for idx, row in filtered_object_cats.iterrows():
    catname = row['Object_Category']
    class_id_name = row['Class'].replace(' ','')
    objclassid = pbf.extract_enum(db, class_id_name, 'Class')
    pdcm.add_category(db, objclassid, catname)
    printProgressBar(idx + 1, len(filtered_object_cats), 'Creating Categories', catname)
```

**What's happening:**
1. The PLEXOS model building process is iterating through categories to create them
2. For each category created, `printProgressBar` is called with:
   - Current iteration number (`idx + 1`)
   - Total number of categories (`len(filtered_object_cats)`)
   - Prefix: `'Creating Categories'`
   - Suffix: `catname` (the category name being created)

3. This creates the progress bar output like:
   ```
   Creating Categories |███-----------------| 17.9% Offshore Wind Radial Fixed Bottom__Electr
   ```

The percentage increases as more categories are processed, and the suffix shows the name of the category currently being created (truncated due to terminal width).
